I’m Tania Risky Muhamad, a full stack software developer, technical writer, and former chef.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
